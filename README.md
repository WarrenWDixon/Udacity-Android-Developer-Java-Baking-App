# Udacity-Android-Developer-Java-Baking-App
This was a programming assignment for the Udacity Android Developers program (Java).
This project demonstrates old school network communication HTTPURLConnection and scanners as well as a simple recyler view.
If I were to write this project today I would use RetroFit.
